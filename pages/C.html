      The C language is a <br>
      - universal, <br>
      - procedural imperative <br>
      computer programming language <br>
      developed by <br>
      - Dennis M. Ritchie <br>
      in <br>
      - 1972 <br>
      at <br>
      - Bell Telephone Laboratories <br>
      to develop the <br>
      - UNIX operating system. <br>
      C is the <br>
      - most widely used computer language. <br>
      <br>
      The C language <br>
      combines elements of <br>
      - high-level languages <br>
      with <br>
      - assembly language <br>
      performance and works close to the computer hardware. <br>
      It allows you to <br>
      - manipulate data at a low level <br>
      and at the same time <br>
      - use high-level constructs <br>
      to <br>
      - control the operation of the program. <br>
      <br>
      The C language was and remained <br>
      - one of the most widespread programming languages. <br>
      This language have found application in many projects, <br>
      including both in <br>
      - operating systems <br>
      and in varius <br>
      - application software <br>
      for many devices - <br>
      from <br>
      - supercomputers to embedded systems.
