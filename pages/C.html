    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="definition">
      The C language is a <br>
      - universal, <br>
      - procedural imperative <br>
      computer programming language <br>
      developed by <br>
      - Dennis M. Ritchie <br>
      in <br>
      - 1972 <br>
      at <br>
      - Bell Telephone Laboratories <br>
      to develop the <br>
      - UNIX operating system. <br>
      C is the <br>
      - most widely used computer language. <br>
      <br>
      The C language <br>
      combines elements of <br>
      - high-level languages <br>
      with <br>
      - assembly language <br>
      performance and works close to the computer hardware. <br>
      It allows you to <br>
      - manipulate data at a low level <br>
      and at the same time <br>
      - use high-level constructs <br>
      to <br>
      - control the operation of the program. <br>
      <br>
      The C language was and remained <br>
      - one of the most widespread programming languages. <br>
      This language have found application in many projects, <br>
      including both in <br>
      - operating systems <br>
      and in varius <br>
      - application software <br>
      for many devices - <br>
      from <br>
      - supercomputers to embedded systems.

    <h2>First C program</h2>
    <p>Learning any language, as a rule, begins with writing a simple program that prints a message to the console. Let's take a look at a program that will print the words "Hello, World!" written in C.</p>
    <pre class="codingC"><code>
  <span class="preCom">#include</span> <span class="preFil">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
  <span class="com">/<span>/</span> First C program</span>

  int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
  }
    </code></pre>
    <pre><samp>
  Hello, World!
  Program ended with exit code: 0
    </samp></pre>
    <p>
      Now let's look at the structure of the program. <br>
      <br>
      A program in C language consists of the following parts:
      <ul>
        <li>Preprocessor Commands</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Instructions</li>
        <li>Comments</li>
      </ul>
      Let's look at these parts of the program next.
